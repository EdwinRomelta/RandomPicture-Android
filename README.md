# RandomPicture-Android
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EdwinRomelta/random-picture-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EdwinRomelta/random-picture-android)

A sample android app built using the Clean architecture while keep same architecture and structure for both android and ios development. The goal of this approach is android developer can review ios developer PR and ios developer can review android developer PR so both platform code keep in sync.

For ios version see in [here](https://github.com/EdwinRomelta/random-picture-ios)
